Bukkit Plugin Template
======================

The Bukkit Plugin Template is a great starting point to develop Bukkit based Minecraft plugins using Maven and Intellij.

There are two module in this project. The plugin development will be done in the plugin module.  The craftbukkit module
exists for full integration into Intellij.  The "Build and Run" configuration is used to run the plugin with the
craftbukkit server.  Debugging in Intellij is also supported.
